Hey reader 👋,

I'm [@luckyrome](https://github.com/luckyrome). I'm a full-stack software developer - which covers from UX 👀 to Server 💻 to Data Analysis 🗺️, and everything in between. My mission is to help as many **people** as I can while keeping my sanity and empathy for my fellow humans ✊.

Aside from being a [professional Software Engineer in Silicon Valley](https://linkedin.com/in/ramiln) I travel ✈️, cook 🔥, and am constantly looking for things to learn 🧠 or improve ⏫.

In the world of side-projects I'm using [Unity](https://unity.com) 🧊, and for myself I'm learning [flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [dart](https://dart.dev)🚙.

You can reach me here on [GitHub 📍](https://github.com/luckyrome) or on [LinkedIn 👔](https://linkedin.com/in/ramiln) if you're looking for something a little more formal.
